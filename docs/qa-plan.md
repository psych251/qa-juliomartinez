# QA plan for the Psych 251 experiment template

**Purpose.** Before students touch this template, walk the full student path with fresh
accounts and fresh eyes, break it on purpose in the ways students will break it, and
record what happened. The instructor cannot test the Stanford-account path; that part is
on you.

**What "ready" means.** Every block below passes for at least one tester, the Stanford
Google-account question has a definite answer, the R Markdown knits on a fresh export,
and every step in `docs/student-guide.md` that took a tester more than five minutes or a
guess has been rewritten.

**Time.** About three hours per tester for blocks A through H; the agent block is another
hour.

## Before you start (instructor)

- [ ] Merge the template branch into `main` ("Use this template" and GitHub Pages both work from `main`).
- [ ] Repo → Settings → General → tick **Template repository**.
- [ ] Org → Settings → Pages: members may publish Pages sites.
- [ ] Decide the class contact address that goes in `EXPERIMENT.contact_email`.

## Testers and roles

| Role | Who | What you bring |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cold student** | TA 1 | Follow `docs/student-guide.md` literally, no agent, no prior knowledge. Time every block. |
| **Agent student** | TA 2 | Do the same path but let Claude Code (or Codex/Cursor) do everything the skills cover. Note where it stalls or misbehaves. |
| **Saboteur** | TA 3 (or TA 1 after finishing) | Blocks F and G: break things on purpose, check the failure is visible and recoverable. |

Everyone needs: membership in the `psych251` GitHub org, a **personal** Google account
*and* your Stanford Google account, Node 18+, Java 17+ (for the emulator), R with
tidyverse and jsonlite, RStudio, and Chrome plus one other browser. A Prolific researcher
account is useful for block E but not required.

## How to record results

Copy the checklist at the bottom into a shared doc, one column per tester. For anything
that is not a clean pass, open a GitHub issue on the template repo with:
the block and step id (e.g. `D4`), what you expected, what happened, a screenshot, the
browser and OS, how long you were stuck, and whether you found a workaround. Tag it
`qa-fall26`. Vague steps in the guide count as bugs.

---

## Block A: repository creation (15 min)

| Id | Step | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | On the template's page, **Use this template → Create a new repository**, owner `psych251`, name `qa-<yourname>`, Public. | Repo exists with all files, no `node_modules`, `firebase-config.js` still says `PASTE_ME`. |
| A2 | Clone it. `npm install`. | Finishes in under three minutes without errors (warnings are fine). |
| A3 | `npm start`, open http://localhost:8000. | Red banner "Data is NOT being saved … placeholder values". Consent screen visible. |
| A4 | Complete the demo once in the browser. | Ends with "All done" and a **Download data (JSON)** button. Download works; file is a JSON array. |
| A5 | Open `index.html` directly from the file system (double-click), no server. | Note what happens. (Expected: the page shows an error or a blank screen; the guide says to use `npm start`. Report whether the guide's warning was enough.) |

## Block B: automated test (10 min)

| Id | Step | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | `npm test` with Java installed. | Downloads the emulator once, then `6 passed`. Under two minutes. |
| B2 | Temporarily rename `java` off your PATH (or use a machine without it), run `npm test`, then `npx playwright test`. | `npm test` fails with a clear message about Java; `npx playwright test` passes one test and skips the rest. Report how clear the Java error was. |
| B3 | Push a commit. Watch the repo's **Actions** tab. | The `test` workflow runs and passes on GitHub. |

## Block C: Firebase project, personal account (30 min)

Follow `docs/student-guide.md` section 2 exactly. Note the time each step takes and any screen that does not match the guide's wording (the console changes often).

| Id | Step | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | Create the project on your **personal** Google account, Analytics off, Spark plan. | Project created, no card requested. |
| C2 | Firestore → Create database → **production mode**. | Database exists. Rules tab shows a deny-all default. |
| C3 | Paste `firebase/firestore.rules`, Publish. | Publishes without syntax errors. |
| C4 | Authentication → Sign-in method → Anonymous → Enable. | Anonymous shows as Enabled. |
| C5 | Register a web app, copy the config, paste into `firebase-config.js`, commit. | File is valid JS (`npm test` still passes). |
| C6 | `npm start`, reload. | No red banner. |
| C7 | Complete the demo. Then Firestore → Data. | `experiments / framing-demo / participants / <id>` exists with `completed: true`, a `condition`, and a `trials` subcollection with one document per trial. |
| C8 | In the Firestore **Rules playground** (Rules tab), simulate `get` on that participant document, unauthenticated and authenticated. | Both denied. |
| C9 | GitHub: after pushing `firebase-config.js`, did GitHub or any tool warn about a secret? | Record exactly what you saw. The guide claims it is safe; check the wording convinced you. |

## Block D: Firebase project, Stanford account (15 min)

This is the question the instructor cannot answer.

| Id | Step | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Signed into your **Stanford** Google account, try to create a Firebase project. | Record: allowed / blocked with message / allowed but Firestore blocked. Screenshot any policy message. |
| D2 | If allowed, repeat C2 through C7 on the Stanford project with a second copy of the repo. | Same results as C. |
| D3 | If blocked, record the exact text so the guide can quote it. | |

## Block E: GitHub Pages and the participant's view (30 min)

| Id | Step | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E1 | Repo → Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch, `main`, `/ (root)`. | URL shown within two minutes; page loads at `https://psych251.github.io/qa-<name>/`. |
| E2 | Complete the demo from the live URL. | New participant document in Firestore. No red banner. |
| E3 | Open the live URL with `?PROLIFIC_PID=qa123&STUDY_ID=s1&SESSION_ID=x1`, complete it. | Participant document has `prolific_pid: qa123`. |
| E4 | Repeat E2 in a second browser (Firefox or Safari) and on your phone. | Works in both. Note layout problems on the phone (the course discourages phones, but the page should not break). |
| E5 | Push a visible change to the debrief text, wait two minutes, hard-reload the live page. | Change visible. Note how long it took. |
| E6 | If you have a Prolific researcher account: create a draft study with the URL from the guide's section 5 and use **Preview**. | Preview reaches the consent page with the ids filled in. Do not publish the study. |

## Block F: induced failures (30 min)

Each of these is something a student will do. The point is that the failure is *visible* and the guide's fix works.

| Id | Break it | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | Authentication → disable Anonymous sign-in. Reload the experiment. | Red banner naming `operation-not-allowed` with the hint to enable Anonymous sign-in. Experiment still runs; ends with the download button. Re-enable afterwards. |
| F2 | Rules tab → replace with `allow read, write: if false;` for everything, Publish. Run the experiment. | Console and banner show `permission-denied` with the "rules published?" hint by the end; download button offered. Restore the rules. |
| F3 | Put `PASTE_ME` back in `firebase-config.js`. | Offline banner (as in A3). Restore. |
| F4 | Start the experiment on the live site, answer three or four trials, close the tab. Check Firestore. | Participant document exists with `completed: false`; `trials` has the trials completed so far. |
| F5 | Start the experiment, then in DevTools set the network to **Offline** before clicking the final **Finish**. | Within about 20 seconds: "Your data was not saved… connection… lost" and a download button. Not stuck on "Saving". |
| F6 | Create a Firestore database in **test mode** in a scratch project and read the rules it generates. | Confirm they contain an expiry date; note the exact wording so the guide can warn about it. Delete the scratch project. |
| F7 | Open the browser console during a normal run. | No red errors. (Warnings are fine.) |

## Block G: data export and analysis (30 min)

| Id | Step | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | Generate a service-account key, save it outside the repo, run `npm run export -- --experiment framing-demo --key <path>`. | `data/raw/framing-demo/` has `participants.csv`, `trials.csv`, `errors.csv`, `export.json`, `identifiers.csv`. Counts match what you ran. |
| G2 | `git status`. | `identifiers.csv` is **not** listed (gitignored). The other files are. |
| G3 | Open `participants.csv` and `trials.csv`. | No Prolific ids, no URL parameters, no IP addresses anywhere. `qa123` from E3 appears only in `identifiers.csv`. |
| G4 | Copy the key file into the repo folder under a name containing `service-account` and run `git status`. | Not listed. Delete the copy. |
| G5 | Open `analysis/analysis.Rmd` in RStudio, install anything missing, **Knit**. | Knits to HTML with a 2x2 table, a chi-square (or a note that a cell is empty with few participants), a proportion difference with CI, and two plots. **This has never been run by the instructor; expect to file issues here.** |
| G6 | Commit the CSVs and push. | Actions still pass. |

## Block H: student guide read-through (20 min)

Read `docs/student-guide.md` and `README.md` start to finish after doing the above.
For each section note: a step you had to guess at, a console screen that no longer matches
the text, a term a first-year would not know, and anything you would cut. File one issue per
section.

## Block I: agent path (60 min, TA 2)

Start from a fresh `qa-agent-<name>` repo from the template. Open Claude Code (or your
agent) in the clone. Do **not** read the guide first; let the agent lead. Keep a log of
every prompt and how many turns each took.

| Id | Ask the agent | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I1 | "Set up Firebase for this experiment." | It hands you the console click list, waits, then verifies the config and connection. It does not try to log the Firebase CLI into Google. |
| I2 | "Replace the demo with a Stroop task: 24 trials, congruent and incongruent, keys r/g/b, 2 s response window, 6 practice trials with feedback. Keep consent, demographics, and debrief. Id `stroop-pilot-a`." | Working experiment, `npm test` green, robot updated, `analysis.Rmd` retargeted. Check the consent text is untouched except the email. |
| I3 | "Deploy this to GitHub Pages and give me the Prolific URL." | Tells you the Pages settings to click, verifies the live URL, produces the parameterized URL. |
| I4 | "Export the data and load it in R." | Asks for the key path, runs the export, does not print or commit the key. |
| I5 | "Review this study against Experimentology." (or `/experimentology-review`) | A review in the skill's format: study summary, must/should/consider, citations to chapter sections, top three. Judge whether a first-year would find it useful and whether anything it says is wrong. |
| I6 | After the session: `git diff main -- firebase/firestore.rules`; `git log -p | grep -i private_key`; grep for `unpkg` and `jsdelivr`. | Rules unchanged, no key in history, no CDN links. |

Report separately: anything the agent did that a student should not have let it do, and any
place the agent asked you something the skills should have answered.

## Known and accepted (do not file)

- The demo's lexical decision block has no practice trials and only eight items. It exists to show trial-level logging, not to be a real task.
- `contact_email` is a placeholder until the instructor sets it.
- The demo consent lists the Stanford Psychology department; that is the approved course text.
- Random assignment is not counterbalanced; the guide says so.
- The page uses browser caching on Pages; a hard reload after a push is expected.
